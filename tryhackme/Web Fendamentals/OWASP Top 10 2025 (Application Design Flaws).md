## Security Misconfigurations
Security misconfigurations happen when systems, servers, or applications are deployed with unsafe defaults, incomplete settings, or exposed services. These are not code bugs but mistakes in how the environment, software, or network is set up. They create easy entry points for attackers.
### Common Patterns
- Default credentials or weak passwords left unchanged
- Unnecessary services or endpoints exposed to the internet
- Misconfigured cloud storage or permissions (S3, Azure Blob, GCP buckets)
- Unrestricted API access or missing authentication/authorisation
- Verbose error messages exposing stack traces or system details
- Outdated software, frameworks, or containers with known vulnerabilities
- Exposed AI/ML endpoints without proper access controls

## Software Supply Chain Failures
Software supply chain failures happen when applications rely on components, libraries, services, or models that are compromised, outdated, or improperly verified. These weaknesses are not inherent in your code, but rather in the software and tools you depend on. Attackers exploit these weak links to inject malicious code, bypass security, or steal sensitive data.
### Common Patterns
- Using unverified or unmaintained libraries and dependencies
- Automatically installing updates without verification
- Over-reliance on third-party AI models without monitoring or auditing
- Insecure build pipelines or CI/CD processes that allow tampering
- Poor license or provenance tracking for components
- Lack of monitoring for vulnerabilities in dependencies after deployment
___
## Cryptographic Failures
Cryptographic failures happen when encryption is used incorrectly or not at all. This includes weak algorithms, hard-coded keys, poor key handling, or unencrypted sensitive data. These flaws let attackers access information that should be private.
### Common Patterns
- Using deprecated or weak algorithms like MD5, SHA-1, or ECB mode
- Hard-coded secrets in code or configuration
- Poor key rotation or management practices
- Lack of encryption for sensitive data at rest or in transit
- Self-signed or invalid TLS certificates
- Using AI/ML systems without proper secret handling for model parameters or sensitive inputs
___
## Insecure Design
Insecure design happens when flawed logic or architecture is built into a system from the start. These flaws stem from skipped threat modelling, no design requirements or reviews, or accidental errors.

Moreover, with the introduction of AI assistants, AI systems exacerbate insecure design. Developers often assume that models are safe, correct, or predictable, or that the code they produce is flaw-free. When an AI system can generate queries, write code, or classify users without limits, the risk is built into the design, leading to poor architectural patterns.
