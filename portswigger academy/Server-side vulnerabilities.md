## File upload
When submitting HTML forms, the browser typically sends the provided data in a `POST` request with the content type `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. This is fine for sending simple text like your name or address. However, it isn't suitable for sending large amounts of binary data, such as an entire image file or a PDF document. In this case, the content type `multipart/form-data` is preferred.
